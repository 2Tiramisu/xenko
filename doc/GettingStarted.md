## Build Instructions

1. Clone Xenko with submodules: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:SiliconStudio/xenko.git <XenkoDir>`
2. Set *SiliconStudioXenkoDir* environment variable to point to your `<XenkoDir>`
3. Open `<XenkoDir>\build\Xenko.sln` with Visual Studio 2013, and build.
4. Open `<XenkoDir>\samples\XenkoSamples.sln` and play with the samples.
5. Optionally, open and build `Xenko.Android.sln`, `Xenko.iOS.sln`, etc...

## Using the editor

Since the Editor depends on Telerik and is not currently included in the source release, you can still use the binaries from the Binary Release version.
