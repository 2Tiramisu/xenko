## Asset control

Until now, all assets of game package and its dependencies were compiled as part of your game. Only solution was to delete those assets, but this makes sharing packages or experimenting with assets much more difficult.

With this new release, we introduce a new feature that allows you to control what assets are compiled.

You simply tag the asset with "Mark as Root" to have them embedded in the current selected game. It will automatically embed those assets and all their dependencies.
